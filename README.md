# Pagination and Content Filter

Uses unobtrusive Javascript to dynamically add pagination to an HTML document.
Added pagination navigation buttons at the bottom of the main content div
show or hide items based on an 'items per page' variable. Added search field shows
or hides results matching queries and updates pagination as necessary. Pagination
navigation only appears if pages required to show content exceed one. If
search finds no matches, error message shown instead.
